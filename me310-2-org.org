** Shaft and Shaft Components

Most engineering systems are powered by rotational machinery such as internal combustion engines and electrical motors. It is, thus, extremely important that we understand and properly design power tranmission mechanism from the rotational machinery power source to intended components. Shafts remains one of the most prevalent methods of transmitting rotational power, and so it is our first chapter into the world of power transmission design.

By itself, shaft design is no more complex than other components under static or cyclic loadings already covered in the first book of this series. However, as shafts lie at the heart of most machine design applications, its final design will also depend on the design of other components that are to be mounted or connected to the shaft.

*** Shaft Materials

There are two main concerns with designing a shaft: deflection and strength. Deflection is not affected by material strength. In fact, it depends only on the stiffness, represented by the Young's modulus. Since the Young's modulus is essentially the same for all steels, material choice matters little for deflection.

Strength, on the other hand, constitute a major concern for shaft design. Strength is necessary to resist loading stresses and fatigue stresses from the constant rotation. Many shafts are made from low carbon, cold-drawn or hot-rolled steel such as ANSI 1020-1050 steels. Significant strengthening from heat treatment or high alloy is often not neeeded. And fatigue failure is only reduced moderately by increase in strength, after a certain level notch sensitivity begins to counteract its benefit.

A good way to select a proper shaft material is to start with an inexpensive low or medium carbon steel for the first round of calculations. If strength considerations turn out to be the limiting factor over deflection, select a higher strength material and reduce the shaft size accordingly until deflection becomes an issue. The cost of the material and its manufacturing processes must be weighed against the need for smaller shaft diameter.

When additional strengthening is needed, typical alloy steels for heat treatment include ANSI 340-50, 3140-50, 4140, 4340, 5140, and 8650. Shafts don't usually need surface hardening unless there is significant risk of wear from journal bearing, in which case surface hardening include carburizing grades of ANSI 1020, 4320, 4820, and 8620. [cite:@shigley2011shigley]

*** Shaft Layout

Generally a shaft is a cylinder with segments of varying cross sections to accommodate components like gears, bearings, pulleys, etc. Shaft shoulders are normally used to axially locate elements and to take any axial thrust loads. illustrates the cross-section of a vertical worm-gear speed reducer. In this figure, the shaft steps are used to axially locate the two tapered bearings and the spur gear.

[[file:pictures/Shafts/speed-reducer-layout.png]]

*** Axial Layout of Components

The axial positioning of components is often preset by the layout of the housing and other meshing components. Generally it is advisable to support any loading-carrying components between bearings. However, pulleys and sprockets tend to be mounted outside of the bearing pairs for ease of installation of the belt or chain. The length of the shaft should be kept as short as possible to minimize deflection and resultant load on the bearings.

In most cases, a shaft will only require two bearings, but in cases with long shafts carrying multiple load-carrying components, it may be necessary to use more than two bearings for additional support. In such a case, particular care must be given to the alignment of the bearings.

*** Supporting Axial Loads

There are use cases where axial loads in shaft may be significant, in which case it is important to provide a means to transfer the axial loads into the shaft. The shaft would then transfer the loads to a bearing and to the ground. This is necessary for shafts mounted with components that generate axial loads like bevel and helical gears, or tapered roller bearings.

It is usually sufficient to have only one bearing carry the axial load. This allows for greater tolerances on shaft length dimensions and prevents binding from shaft thermal expansions, which is especially significant in long shafts.

*** Support for Torque Transmission

Most shafts serve to transfer torque from an input (gear, pulley, engine, motor, etc.) to an output gear or pulley. The shaft must be sized to support torsional stress and its resultant angle of twist. It is also important to provide a way to transmit the torque between the gear (or pulley) and the shaft itself. Common torque transfer methods are:

- Keys
- Splines
- Setscrews
- Pins
- Press or shrink fits
- Tapered fits

There are also shafts that are designed to fail if excessive torque is
applied, to prevent failure of more expensive components. Details of the
components and their design process is covered in .

*** Shaft Design for Stress

It is not always necessary to evaluate stresses at every point; the same goes for shafts as well. Only a few potentially critical locations should be more than enough. Since the main types of load on shafts are torsion and bending, it follows that most critical locations on the shafts are on the outer surface--typically where the bending moment is large, the torque is large, and where stress concentrations exist.

In order to determine the bending moments, torques, and shear forces on a shaft, it is usually a good idea to draw shear and bending moment diagrams. Since most shafts are loaded by gears and pulleys, introducing forces in two planes, two diagrams are needed to determine the loads. Resultant moments can be obtained simply by adding the moments as vectors at points of interest. The normal stress due to bending will be highest on the outer surfaces and will contribute to fatigue on a rotating shaft.

Axial stresses on shafts from axial loads caused by helical gears or tapered roller bearings are typically negiligible compared to the bending stress. The axial stresses are also usually constant, meaning that they rarely contribute significantly to fatigue. However, axial stresses resulting from axial loads applied through other means should be explicitly considered.

Let us now consider the shaft stresses, which are usually the combination of normal stresses from bending and axial stresses, and shear stress from torsion.

\begin{align}
  \label{eq: shaft normal and shear stresses}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \sigma_a = K_f \dfrac{M_a y}{I} & \sigma_m = K_f \dfrac{M_m y}{I} \\[1em]
    \tau_a = K_{fs} \dfrac{T_a r}{J} & \tau_m = K_{fs} \dfrac{T_m r}{J}
  \end{array}
\end{align}

If we assume a solid shaft with circular cross section, we can further simplify the expression to

\begin{align}
  \label{eq: shaft normal and shear stresses simplify}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \sigma_a = K_f \dfrac{32M_a}{\pi d^3} & \sigma_m = K_f \dfrac{32M_m}{\pi d^3} \\[1em]
    \tau_a = K_{fs} \dfrac{16T_a}{\pi d^3} & \tau_m = K_{fs} \dfrac{16T_m }{\pi d^3}
  \end{array}
\end{align}

The stresses can be combined into stress amplitude and average stress using maximum distortion energy theory (MDET or von Mises) as

\begin{align}
  \label{eq: von mises shaft stress}
  \sigma_{ae} &= \left( \sigma_a^2 + 3\tau_a^2 \right)^{1/2} = \left[ \left( \dfrac{32 K_fM_a}{\pi d^3} \right)^2 + 3\left( \dfrac{16 K_{fs} T_a}{\pi d^3} \right)^2 \right]^{1/2} \\
  \sigma_{me} &= \left( \sigma_m^2 + 3\tau_m^2 \right)^{1/2} = \left[ \left( \dfrac{32 K_fM_m}{\pi d^3} \right)^2 + 3\left( \dfrac{16 K_{fs} T_m}{\pi d^3} \right)^2 \right]^{1/2}
\end{align}

The stress concentration factors for the average stress component in ductile materials can sometimes be ignored since the materilas can yield locally at the discontinuity.

These equivalent stresses can be evaluated in design equations to determine the safety factor \(N_s\) or the required diameter \(d\) using the the modified Goodman diagram as

\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{N_s} = \frac{\sigma_{ae}}{S_e} + \frac{\sigma_{me}}{S_{ut}}
\end{align}

Substituting for \(\sigma_{ae}\) and \(\sigma_{me}\) results in

\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{N_s} = \frac{16}{\pi d^3} \left\{ \frac{1}{S_e} \left[ 4 \left( K_f M_a \right)^2 + 3 \left( K_{fs} T_a \right)^2 \right]^{1/2} + \frac{1}{S_{ut}} \left[ 4 \left( K_f M_m \right)^2 + 3 \left( K_{fs} T_m \right)^2 \right]^{1/2} \right\}
\end{align}

The required diameter \(d\) can be solved from the previous equation as

\begin{align}
  d = \left( \frac{16N_s}{\pi} \left\{ \frac{1}{S_e} \left[ 4 \left( K_f M_a \right)^2 + 3 \left( K_{fs} T_a \right)^2 \right]^{1/2} + \frac{1}{S_{ut}} \left[ 4 \left( K_f M_m \right)^2 + 3 \left( K_{fs} T_m \right)^2 \right]^{1/2} \right\} \right)^{1/3}
\end{align}

In many applications, rotating shafts will be under constant bending and torsion, resulting in completely reverse bending stress (\(M_m = 0\)) and constant torsional shear stress (\(T_a = 0\)). This means the required diameter becomes

\begin{align}
  d = \left( \frac{16N_s}{\pi} \left\{ \frac{2 K_f M_a}{S_e} + \frac{\sqrt{3} K_{fs} T_m}{S_{ut}} \right\} \right)^{1/3}
\end{align}

so that the safety factor \(N_{s}\) = 3.

***** Solution

   There is also 2040 N of force pulling at the pulley due to the combined belt tension. The torque generates shear stress throughout the shaft, with the maximum value at the surface. The belt tension creates bending stresses, whose maximum values are are the top and bottom of the shaft at the middle. This means that the critical points on the shaft (without considering stress concentration from the key/keyseat) are at the top and bottom of the shaft at the middle. In this problem, we will take the bottom of the shaft at the middle. The stress concentration of the keyseat is taken to be \(K_{f}\) = 2.14 in bending and \(K_{fs}\) = 3.0 in torsion.

2. Soderberg: using the criteria, we must calculate the minimum and maximum bending moments and torques, which will then be used to determine the stress amplitudes and average stresses. We already determine the maximum bending moment and torque, which we used to determine the corresponding stresses for MDET. We now only need to find out the minimum bending moment and torque. The minimum bending moment occurs when the shaft rotates by half a revolution, for which the beam willbe under a compressive stress of the same magnitude.

   If the shaft is under continuous operation, the applied torque is constant, which means that the torque amplitude \(T_{a}\) = 0 and the average torque \(T_{m} = T\). We can plug this into the sequation to determine equivalent amplitude and average stresses.

\begin{align}

\end{align}

We must first convert the angular velocity into rad/s: 10000 rpm = 10000(2\(\pi\)/60) = rad/s. To achieve the safety factor of 3, the first natural frequency of the shaft must be

r &=0.044\text{ m}
\end{align*}

The designed shaft has to follow the largest shaft that satisfy each of the condition, therefore the required radius is 4.4 cm.

*** Torque Trasmission Components

For a designed shaft to properly transfer torque to its intended target, not only must the shaft be able to with stand the stresses resulting from the torque, but it must also be assembled with torque transmission components that are capable of transferring such torque. Some of the mechanisms currently in use can be categorized into:

1. Mechanical drive assembly
2. Interference fit assembly
3. Welded assembly

**** Mechanical Drive Assembly

Mechanical drive assembly typically requires adjustments to the shaft and/or hub of the component to be assembled. The most common mechanical-drive assembly is the conventional key and keyway. Other assemblies are set screws, pins, and spline shafts.

***** Keys and Pins

Keys are axially inserted metal that provides interference between the shaft and hub, allowing torque trasmission between the two. Aligning keyways need to be cut into both the shaft and the hub.

Pins, on the other hand, are transversely inserted perpendicular to the axis of the shaft. Both the shaft and hub still needs to be drilled.

[[./pictures/Shafts/keys-pins.png]]

While pins allow for torque transmission and axial positioning, keys only allow torque transmission. However, because of the typical long length of keys inserted axially which provides larger cross-sectional area, they typically allow larger torque trasmission than pins of the same size.

Torque capacity of keys and pins can be calculated by

\begin{align*}
  P_{\max} &= \frac{S_{y}}{\sqrt{3}}A = 0.577 S_{y}A \\
  T_{\max} &= P_{\max}r_{\text{shaft}}
\end{align*}

*** Limitation of Mechanical Drive Assembly

Mechanical drive assembly can provide relatively high torque transmission with relatively easy assembly. However, they have a few shortcomings to consider.

1. Stress concentration: shafts and hubs need to be machined to provide holes/keyways/splines, which will obviously introduce increased stress concentration and thus reduced shaft/hub strength.

2. Backlash: even with very strict tolerances, pins and keys that do not perfectly fit in the holes or keyways will allow relative motion between the shaft and the hub, leading to backlashes. However, this can be eliminated or mitigated with the use of tapered keys or pins.

   Tapered keys or pins have a slowly increasing cross section from one end to the other, therefore allowing a snug fit.

3. Machining costs: as keyways/splines/holes require precise machining, this will incur additional costs on the shaft assembly.

4. Uneven distribution of mass: uniform distribution of mass about the shaft is extremely important for shaft stability especially in high speed application. Usually components such as gears, pulleys, sprockets, etc. are designed to be axisymmetric for this reason. However, the required machining and insertion of keys or pins will introduce asymmetry to the shaft assembly.

***** Example: Key Sizing

A steel shaft whose $S_y$ = 450 MPa has a diameter of 5 cm. The shaft rotates at 600 rpm and transmits 40 hp through a gear. Select an appropriate key for the gear. Use safety factor = 3.

#+CAPTION: Key and shaft cross section for example ...
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[circle, draw, fill=gray!20, minimum height=2cm](shaft){};
    \node at (shaft.north) [draw, fill=gray!80, minimum height=5mm, minimum width=5mm](key){};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

***** Solution: Key Sizing

  To keep things simple, pick a square key and pick key length = 2 cm.

  \begin{align*}
    T &= \frac{H}{\omega} = \frac{40(746)}{600(2\pi/60)} \\
      &= 475 \text{ N-m}
  \end{align*}

  For the width (and height) of the key section,

  \begin{align*}
    N_{s} T_{\max} &= 0.577S_{y}blr_{\text{shaft}} \\
    b &= \frac{3(475)}{0.577(450 \times 10^{6})(0.02)(0.05)} \\
    b &= 0.00549 \text{ m}
  \end{align*}

*** Interference Fit Assemblies

Interference fit refers to a type of joint that relies on friction between the hub and shaft to transfer torque. The friction results from the compression of the hub on the shaft, which means the diameter of the hole on the hub must be slightly smaller than that of the shaft. These type of assemblies are divided into 3 categories based on method of assembly.

1. Press fit:

   The word 'press' here refers to the assembly method of pressing the shaft into a hole that is slightly smaller. This process relies on the elasticity of both materials to allow the shaft to slide in without any permanent deformation. This requires extremely strict tolerances on both the shaft and the hub.

2. Tapered fit:

   In case of tapered fits, an additional collet, which is a collar that is tapered on the outside along the length, and has a constant cross section on the inside. The collet essentially acts like a wedge between the shaft and hub, allowing the assembler to control the magnitude of compressive (and resulting friction) force on the shaft by the axial load exerted on the collet.

3. Shrink fit:

   Similar to press fit in that there is no additional 'collet', but instead of 'pressing' the shaft onto the hub, either the shaft is cooled or the hub is heated (or both) before assembly. This eliminates the difficulty of assembly and allows for greater difference in the diameters of the shaft and hub.

These interference fits do not require additional machining on the shaft or hub, which would otherwise increase the stress concentration and incur additional machine costs. However, they do have the following limitations to take into consideration.

1. Materials, surface, and design restrictions: interference fits rely on friction, so the material, surface finishing, and shaft dimensions (diameter mostly) affect the magnitude of friction that can be generated. This limits your available choices.

2. Close tolerance: interference fits require that the hubs and shafts have extremely close and accurate tolerances, requiring precise machining. This leads to high machining costs.

3. Fretting: high stress on surfaces that undergo repeated motions are prone to fretting corrosion.

4. Surface galling: high compressive load on mating surfaces can cause them bind. This complicates dissasembly, which usually results in surface failure.

5. High stress in components: interference fit requires high compressive force from the hub on the shaft to generate friction. This leads to circumferential stresses on the hub and the shaft as well.

*** Stresses in Interference Fits

Assumed uniform pressure on shaft (i) and hub (o)

\begin{align*}
  p &= \frac{d_{\text{shaft}} - d_{\text{hub}}}{\dfrac{d}{E_{o}} \left( \dfrac{d_{o}^{2} + d^{2}}{d_{o}^{2} - d^{2}} + \nu_{o} \right) + \dfrac{d}{E_{i}}\left( \dfrac{d^{2} + d_{i}^{2}}{d^{2} - d_{i}^{2}} - \nu_{i} \right)}
\end{align*}

When both are of the same material

\begin{align*}
  p &= \frac{E(d_{\text{shaft}} - d_{\text{hub}})}{2d^{3}} \left[ \frac{(d_{o}^{2} - d^{2})(d^{2} - d_{i}^{2})}{d_{o}^{2} - d_{i}^{2}} \right]
\end{align*}

Tangential and radial stresses in shaft and hub are

\begin{align}
  \sigma_{t,\text{shaft}} &= -p \frac{d^{2} + d_{i}^{2}}{d^{2} - d_{i}^{2}} \\
  \sigma_{t,\text{hub}} &= p \frac{d_{o}^{2} + d^{2}}{d_{o}^{2} - d^{2}} \\
  \sigma_{r,\text{shaft}} &= -p \\
  \sigma_{r,\text{hub}} &= -p
\end{align}

Combine $\sigma_{t}$ and $\sigma_{r}$ using MDET to determine failure

*** Torque Capacity of Interference Fits

Depends on friction generated between shaft and hub $\rightarrow$ pressure from interference fits

\begin{align}
  f &= \mu N = \mu (pA) \nonumber \\
    &= \pi \mu pld \\
  T &= fd/2 = \pi \mu pld(d/2) \nonumber \\
    &= \frac{\pi}{2}\mu pld^{2}
\end{align}

***** Example: Torque Capacity of an Interference Fit

A solid shaft whose diameter is 5 cm is pressed onto a gear whose hub inner diameter is 4.99 cm and outer diameter is 6 cm. If both are made of the same steel whose $E$ = 210 GPa and $\nu$ = 0.3, determine the radial and tangential stresses, along with the torque capacity of the fit. Assume steel-on-steel $\mu$ = 0.3, and the hub is 7 cm long.

***** Solution: Torque Capacity of an Interference Fit

\begin{align*}
  p &= \frac{E(d_{\text{shaft}} - d_{\text{hub}})}{2d^{3}} \left[ \frac{(d_{o}^{2} - d^{2})(d^{2} - d_{i}^{2})}{d_{o}^{2} - d_{i}^{2}} \right] \\
    &= \frac{210 \times 10^{9} (0.05 - 0.0499)}{2(0.05)^{3}} \left[ \frac{(0.06^{2} - 0.05^{2})(0.05^{2} - 0)}{0.06^{2} - 0} \right] \\
    &= 64.2 \text{ MPa} \\
  \sigma_{r,\text{shaft}} &= \sigma_{r,\text{hub}} = -64.2 \text{ MPa} \\
  \sigma_{t,\text{shaft}} &= -64.2 \frac{0.05^{2}}{0.05^{2}} = -64.2 \text{ MPa} \\
  \sigma_{t,\text{hub}} &= 64.2 \frac{0.06^{2} + 0.05^{2}}{0.06^{2} - 0.05^{2}} = 356 \text{ MPa} \\
  T &= \frac{\pi}{2}\mu pld^{2} = \frac{\pi}{2}(0.3) 64.2 \times 10^{6} (0.07)(0.05^{2}) = 5294 \text{ N-m}
\end{align*}

*** Weld Assembly

In weld assemby, the shaft and hub of intended components are welded together. This provides a relatively quick and permanent connection between the components. However, weld assemblies also inherit the same disadvantages from welded joints as mentioned in chapter ....

1. Welding only works on compatible materials. Plastics on metals is a no-no. Woods cannot be welded. Ceramics cannot be welded. You get the idea.

2. Heating can cause warpage. Welding introduces uneven heating of the workpiece, which can result in warpage especially in parts with complex geometries.

3. Disassembly. Welding is permanent... mostly. Welding can be undone, although the process is not straightforward and can cause permanent surface damages.

4. Skilled personnel. Welding requires skilled craftmanship, which means it is usually expensive and its quality is hard to control.

5. Cleaning and machining. Welding typically needs cleaning and machining afterwards to obtain desirable surface finish.

*** Torque Capacity in Weld Assembly

The strength of weld can be applied to determine the torque capacity of shafts and their components in weld assembly. In most cases, weld joints in weld assembly are fillet welds and the corresponding equations apply.

** Journal Bearings and Lubrication

*** Overview of Bearings

*** What are bearings?

- A feature that allows relative motions between components

  - Linear motions

  - Rotary motions

*** Two types of bearings

- Contact: sliding or rolling

- Non-contact: fluid film or magnetic

** Sliding Contact Bearings

Contact bearings are features that allow relative movements between two surfaces wherein the surfaces remain in contact with each other either directly or indirectly through some solid common medium.

*** Sliding Contact Bearings

In a sliding contact bearing, the shaft is directly in contact with the inner surface of the bearing. As the shaft rotates, this causes relative motions (sliding) between the shaft and the bearing--hence the name. Because of this sliding, friction plays a significant role in this type of bearings. Special care must be taken to select the materials of both the shaft and bearing so that it can withstand the conditions.

#+CAPTION: Brass sliding contact bearing
[[./pictures/Bearings/sliding-contact-bearing.jpg]]

Because of friction, sliding contact bearings are typically used in low- to medium-speed applications. The bearings are also used with lubrication to reduce wear and improve its performance.

*** Materials Selection for Sliding Contact Bearing

Materials that are chosen for sliding contact bearings are, for the most part, softer that the shaft; it is usually easier to switch out worn bearings than worn shafts.

Even though the bearings are designed for wear, we must make sure that it can handle the contact pressure and the heat generation rate.

First, the contact pressure from the shaft depends on the radial force exerted by the shaft and the effective area of contact. For a bearing of length $L$ and inner diameter $D$, the average contact pressure generated from the shaft with radial force $F$ is
\begin{align}
  P_{\text{avg}} &= \frac{F}{DL}
\end{align}
The maximum contact pressure is at the bottom of the contact area, where the surface vector is in the same direction as the radial force.
\begin{align}
  P_{\max} &= \frac{4}{\pi} \frac{F}{DL}
\end{align}
Secondly, the heat generation rate depends on the friction and the surface velocity of the shaft. Friction depends on the radial force (similar to contact pressure), while the surface velocity can be calculated by
\begin{equation}
  v = \omega \frac{D}{2}
\end{equation}
The heat generation rate is friction force multiplied by the surface velocity. Since friction depends on the contact pressure, rate of heat generation is simply a function of contact pressure and surface velocity.
\begin{equation}
  \dot{Q} = f(PV)
\end{equation}
Therefore, in material catalogs that list properties for sliding contact bearings under $P$, $V$, and $PV$, the last one indicates the heat generation rate of the materials.

***** Example: Sleeve Bearing for a Low-speed Shaft

A 30-cm long shaft whose diameter \(D\) is 3 cm is operated at 1000 rpm. The shaft has a spur gear whose \(R_{\text{pitch}}\) = 10 cm mounted in the middle with a bearing at each end. The gear is transferring the power of 1.5 kW. The gear has pressure vessel \(\theta\) = 20\(^{\circ}\). Determine the minimum bearing length \(L\) using nylon.

***** Solution

First, let us determine the force on the bearing. Since spur gears don't generate any axial load, the forces will simply be the radial + tangential load, perpendicular to the shaft.

\begin{align*}
  T &= \frac{P}{\omega} \\
    &= \frac{1500}{1000(2\pi / 60)} = 14.3 \text{ N-m} \\
  F &= \frac{T}{R_{\text{pitch}} \cos \theta} \\
    &= \frac{14.3}{0.1 \cos 20^{\circ}} = 152 \text{ N}
\end{align*}

Since the gear is mounted in the middle, the force on each bearing is half of the force.

\begin{align*}
    F_{bearing} = \frac{152}{2} = 76 \text{ N}
\end{align*}

We can't determine the bearing pressure yet since we don't know the bearing length. We can determine the surface velocity, however.

\begin{align*}
    v = \omega (D/2) = 1000 (2\pi / 60) (0.03/2) = 1.57 \text{ m/s}
\end{align*}

We double-check that \(v < V_{nylon} (1.57 < 3.0)\) so nylon is an
acceptable choice. The length of bearing, then should be

\begin{align*}
  P_{bearing}v &< (PV)_{nylon} \\
  \frac{F_{bearing}}{DL}v &< 0.11 \times 10^6 \\
  \frac{76}{0.03L} 1.57 &< 1.1 \times 10^5 \\
  L &> 0.036 = 3.6 \text{ cm}
\end{align*}

** Rolling-Contact Bearings

Another type of bearings avoids friction by introducing rolling elements between the inner surface (in contact with shaft) and outer surface (in contact with hub). The rolling elements can be spherical, cylindrical, or conical. Because these bearings eliminate friction almost entirely, they are suitable for medium to high-speed applications.

The study of this topic differs from others in that the bearings have already been designed. Our job is not so much a designer but instead a selector--we need to specify the required dimensions, required load, and life to select a suitable bearing for our needs.

*** Bearing Types

A rolling-contact baring has four essential parts--the outer ring, the inner ring, the balls or rolling elements, and the separator. The separator has the important fuction of separating the balls or rolling elements so they do not rub against one another.

        0.911 F_a & e > 10

    \right.
\end{align}

*** Typical Bearing Design Life


**** Radial Ball Bearing Selection

Select a radial ball bearing for a shaft intended for a continuous 8-hr-a-day operation at 1800 rpm with 95% reliability. Axial and radial loads are 1.2 kN and 1.5 kN, respectively.

**** Solution

First, we need to calculated \(F_e\).

\[e = \frac{F_a}{F_r} = \frac{1.2}{1.5} = 0.8\]

For radial ball bearing,

\begin{align*}
  F_{e} &= F_r \left[ 1 + 0.87(e - 0.68) \right] \\
        &= 1500 \left[ 1 + 1.115(0.8 - 0.35) \right] \\
        &= 2276 \text{ N}
\end{align*}

Required life for 8-hr-a-day service (assumed every day) = 30000 hrs

Life in revolutions

\[L = 1800(30000)(60) = 3.24 \times 10^9 \text{ revolutions}\]

For 95% reliability \(K_r\) = 0.63

\begin{align*}
    C = 2276 \left( \frac{3.24 \times 10^9}{0.63 (9 \times 10^7)} \right)^{0.3} = 7661 \text{ N} = 7.66 \text{ kN}
\end{align*}

For extra-light, light, and medium series, the required bore are 55, 35,
and 30 mm, respectively

The models corresponding to the bore are L11, 207, and 306,
respectively.

** Gears

Gears are used to transfer high torque over short distances. Because gears are typically made of strong materials, they are able to transfer high amount of torque compared to their sizes. In this chapter, we will address the overall tpics on gears: gear types, gear train, and forces. Afterwards, we will be dealing with each type of gears--spur, helical, bevel, and worm--individually.

*** Gear Overview

Gears are used to transfer torque over short distances, and moreover, to convert power from low torque and high speed to high torque and low speed. This is especially useful since generating high torque is expensive while generating high speed is not.


Principles of Gears

- Allow positive engagement between teeth

- High forces can be transmitted while in rolling contact

- Do not need friction to operate

*** Types of Gears

/Spur gears/ have teeth that are parallel to the axis of rotation and are used to transmit motion between two parallel shafts. They are the simplest of the gears and will be used to explain gear tooth geometries and basic law of gearing.

/Helical gears/ have teeth inclined to the axis of rotation. They can be used for the same applications as spur gears to lower the noise because of their more gradual teeth engagement. They are also sometimes used to transmit motion between two nonparallel shafts.

/Bevel gears/ have teeth that formed on conical surfaces and are used to transfer torques between intersecting shafts.

/Worms/ and /worm gears/ are used to transfer torque between nonparallel and nonintersecting shafts. The worm resembles a screw, while the worm gear resembles a helical gears. They are used when the speed ratios between the shafts are high.
Basic Law of Gearing

- Point of contact between two mating gears is always the same relative
  distances from the two centers.

- Any gear tooth profiles that follow the law of gearing will result in
  constant relative speed of rotation

*** Gear Geometry


The /pitch circle/ is the theoretical circle that all of the gear geometry is based. The diameter of this circle is called the /pitch diameter/. The pitch circles of a pair of mating gears are tangent to each other.

The /circular pitch p/ is the distance from a point on one tootht to a corresponding point on an adjacent tooth. Therefore the circular pitch is equal to the sum of the /tooth thickness/ and the /width of space/.

The module of a Gear, \(m\), is the ratio of the pitch diameter to the number of teeth.

  \begin{align}
    m = \frac{D_{\text{pitch}}}{z}
  \end{align}

- A pair of meshing gears must have the same modules!

Gear Types

Gear Terminology

- Pinion :: smaller of two gears, usually driving

- Gear :: Larger of the two. Also called /wheel/. Usually driven.

Gear Materials

- Steel: medium-carbon steel + heat treatment + grinding

- Cast iron: surface fatigue > bending fatigue

- Nonferrous: bronzes \(\rightarrow\) corrosion + wear resistant, low
  friction

- Nonmetallic: Nylon \(\rightarrow\) low friction and weight + corrosion
  resistant, but low thermal conductivity

Gear Efficiency

- With friction, gears are 90 - 95% efficient because of mostly rolling
  contact

  \begin{align}
    T_{\text{out}} &= \frac{\eta T_{\text{in}} d_{\text{out}}}{d_{\text{in}}} \\
    \omega_{\text{out}} &= \frac{\omega_{\text{in}} d_{\text{in}}}{d_{\text{out}}} \\
    P_{\text{out}} &= T_{\text{out}} \omega_{\text{out}}
  \end{align}

*** Gear Trains

Gear Trains When large reduction is required

- Large gear + small pinion: simple, but large stress and interference

- Multiple pairs of gears and pinions: less simple, low stress, large
  space

- Planetary gears: complex, low stress, small space

Normal Gear Trains

\begin{align}
    e_{total} &= e_{1}e_{2}\cdots
  \end{align}

Planetary/Epicyclic Gear Train

- Planetary or epicyclic gears enable a high reduction ratio in small
  spaces

Planetary Gear Components

Planetary Gears: Torque, Forces, and Reduction Ratios

- Symmetry \(\rightarrow\) no net force on shaft

- Multiple planet gears reduce individual torque/force

- Any combination of fixed, input, output gears

- 1 gear box -> multiple gear reduction ratios

Fixed ring:\\

\begin{align*}
  \omega_{\text{carrier}} &= 9 \\
  \omega_{\text{planet}} &= (9) \frac{60/2 + 20/2}{20/2} = 36 \\
  \omega_{\text{sun}} &= (36) \frac{20}{30} = 24 \\
  e &= 9/24 = 0.375
\end{align*}

#+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t
| Fixed   | Input     | Planet | Output    | e    |
|---------+-----------+--------+-----------+-------|
| Ring    | Carrier 9 | 36     | Sun 24    | 0.375 |
| Sun     | Carrier 9 | 36     | Ring 14.4 | 0.625 |
| Carrier | Sun 9     | 27     | Ring 5.4  | 1.667 |

** Spur Gears

Spur gears have straight involute teeth. They transfer torque by applying forces perpendicular to their involute face. And because their teeth are perpendicular to their axis, spur gears do not generate axial loads--they generate only tangential and radial forces.

#+NAME: eq: spur gear forces
\begin{align}
  F_{t} &= \frac{T}{R_{\text{pitch}}} \\
  F_{r} &= F_{t} \tan \phi \\
  F_{a} &= 0
\end{align}

The tangential force is perpendicular to gear teeth, leading to tooth bending

*** Spur Gear Stress

The equation for bending stress in spur gears is a modified lewis equation that takes into account the shapes, stress concentrations, and operating conditions of the gear.

- Bending Stress \(\rightarrow\) AGMA stress equation

- Consider tooth as a cantilever beam

  \begin{align}
    \sigma = \frac{F_{t}}{bY_{J}m} K_{O} K_{m} K_{v}
  \end{align}

- \(F_{t}\) :: tangential force

- \(b\) :: face width

- \(Y_{J}\) :: geometry factor

- \(m\) :: module

The geometry factor $Y_J$ takes into account the involute shape and stress concentration factor of the tooth.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width \textwidth
#+CAPTION: Geometry factor $Y_J$ for spur gear design
#+NAME: fig: spur geometry factor
[[./pictures/Gears/geometry-factor.png]]

From Figure [[fig: spur geometry factor]], gears with large number of teeth or that are mating with gears with large number of teeth have higher geometry factors, leading to lower bending stresses. This is because large number of teeth means the teeth are shorter, hence the lower stresses.

Overload Factor: \(K_{O}\)

This factor takes into account the shock and impact loading during operation, which can cause a sharp increase in the stress. We consider the source of shock and impact loading from both the power source (input) and the driven machine (output).

Power sources can be categorized based on their shock/impact loading generated, along with some examples, as follows.

- Uniform :: Electric motor, constant-speed turbine

- Light :: Water turbine, variable-speed drive

- Moderate :: Multicylinder engine

Driven machines are categorized based on operating conditions, which depends mostly on the resisting load on the system.

- Uniform :: Continuous generator

- Light :: Fans, low-speed pumps, conveyors

- Moderate :: high-speed pumps, compressors, heavy conveyers

- Heavy :: rock crushers, punch press drivers

Mounting Factor: \(K_{m}\)

The factor accounts for the increase in stress when tooth faces do not align perfectly. This can happen due to inaccurate mountings, the use of normal (rather than precision) gears, or off-center mountings.

Velocity Factor: \(K_{v}\)

This factor accounts for the increase in stress from increased pitch line velocity of the gears. This combines with the overloading factor $K_O$ to describe the effect of shock and impact loading on stress.

**** Gear Material Strength $S_e^{\prime}$

Because they are used exclusively in rotational machinery, gears are constantly under repeated loadings. Thus, their main mode of failure is fatigue. Hence, whenever we consider the strength of gear material for design, endurance limits should be the first factor on our list.
\begin{align}
  S_{e}^{\prime} = S_{e}C_{L}C_{G}C_{S}k_{r}k_{t}k_{ms}
\end{align}
where

- \(S_{e}\) :: endurance limit

- \(C_{L}\) :: load factor (= 1 for bending)

- \(C_{G}\) :: gradient surface = 1

- \(C_{S}\) :: surface factor (= 0.75 for machined surface)

- \(k_{r}\) :: reliability factor

- \(k_{t}\) :: temperature factor

- \(k_{ms}\) :: median-stress factor (1 for two-way bending (followers), 1.4 for one-way bending (input or output))

Now let us consider each of endurance limit modifier in more details.

Reliability Factor: \(k_{r}\)

Since most material properties--endurance limits included--are reported by their average values, obviously there will be a gear whose actual endurance limit is lower than the reported value. This reliability factor represents this probability so that a given design based on the reduced endurance limit will have a higher probability of achieving the designated lifetime.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :booktabs t
#+NAME: tab: gear reliability factor
#+CAPTION: Gear reliability factor $k_r$
| Reliability (%) | \(k_{r}\) |
|-----------------+-----------|
| 50              | 1.000     |
| 90              | 0.897     |
| 99              | 0.814     |
| 99.9            | 0.753     |
| 99.99           | 0.702     |
| 99.999          | 0.659     |

Temperature Factor: \(k_{t}\)

Temperature directly affects endurance limit as already discussed in "Introduction to Theories of Failure" chapter.

\begin{align}
  k_{t} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{cl}
    1 & T \leqslant 160 \text{ F} \\
    \hspace{5mm} \\
    \dfrac{620}{460 + T} & T > 160 \text{ F}
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{align}

Aside from the strength criteria governed by the given equations. There are more 'guidelines' -- a set of recommended rules -- that can be used to facilitate the spur gear design process.

1. \(e \leqslant 1/6\)

2. Use multi-stage gears for larger than \(e > 1/6\)

3. \(8m \leqslant b \leq 16m\)

4. many small teeth \(\gg\) few large teeth

5. few teeth \(\rightarrow\) small gear, but be careful about
   interference

6. Avoid exact ratio \(\rightarrow\) hunting tooth

***** Example: Spur gear design for a conveyor belt

A pair of spur gears with face width \(b\) = 3 cm is used in a conveyor belt drive. The input motor has \(\omega_{\max}\) of 200 rad/s. The pinion has 18 teeth. The conveyor has moderate shock and should be driven at 100 rad/s. The gears have pressure angles \(\theta\) of 20\(^{\circ}\). Both pinion and gear has \(m\) = 1 cm. Determine the maximum power that the gears caan transmit continuously with 1% chance of bending fatigue failure. Steel has \(S_{ut}\) = 400 MPa

***** Solution: spur gear design for a conveyor belt

First, the bending fatigue stress is

\begin{align*}
  \sigma &= \frac{F_{t}}{bY_{J}m} K_{O}K_{m}K_{v} \\
         &= \frac{F_{t}}{(0.03)(0.32)(0.01)} (1.25)(1.6) \left( \frac{65.12 + \sqrt{200(18)}}{65.12} \right)^{0.73} \\
         &= 33542 F_{t}
\end{align*}

Next, the material fatigue strength is

\begin{align*}
  S_{e}^{\prime} &= S_{e}C_{L}C_{G}C_{S}k_{r}k_{t}k_{ms} \\
                 &= (400 \times 10^{6}(0.5))(1)(1)(0.75)(0.814)(1)(1.4) \\
                 &= 1.71 \times 10^{8}
  \end{align*}

We can then find the maximum allowable tangential force

\begin{align*}
  F_{t} &= \frac{1.71 \times 10^{8}}{33542} = 5096 \text{ N} \\
  P &= T \omega = F_{t} v_{pitch} = 5096 \times 18 = 9.17 \times 10^{4} \text{ W}
\end{align*}

*** Rack and Pinion

Racks are essentially linear spur gears--the teeth line up on a straight rather than a circular path. When used with gears, the pairs can convert torque and rotational motion to force and linear motion. They are less expensive than power screws, but also less accurate and provide no mechanical advantages.

As they are considered linear spur gears, the forces acting on them are identical to those on spur gears.

\begin{align}
  \begin{array}{ll}
  F_{t} &= \dfrac{T}{R_{\text{pitch}}} \\
  F_{r} &= F_t \tan \phi \\
  F_{a} &= 0
  \end{array}
\end{align}

** Helical Gears

Another type of gears have teeth that are slanted at a constant angle, forming helices about their axes of rotation. These are called *helical gears*.


*** Helical Gear Analysis

Geometrically, they can be analyze similarly to spur gears, the only different being that the teeth are at an angle of $\psi$ with the gear axis.

#+NAME: fig: helical gear forces
#+CAPTION: Forces acting on a helical gear
[[./pictures/Gears/helical-gear-forces.png]]

  \begin{align}
    F_{t} &= \frac{H}{v_{t}} \\
    F_{r} &= F_{t} \tan \phi_{t} \\
    F_{a} &= F_{t} \tan \psi \\
    \tan \phi_{n} &= \tan \phi_{t} \cos \psi \\
    m_{n} &= m_{t} \cos \psi
  \end{align}

Design Equations Same as spur gear equation with small modification
\begin{align}
    \sigma &= \frac{F_{t}}{bY_{J}m} K_{v} K_{o} (0.93 K_{m}) \\
    S_{e}^{\prime} &= S_{e}C_{L}C_{G}C_{S}k_{r}k_{t}k_{ms}
  \end{align}

- 0.93 :: indicated helical gears less sensitivity to mounting factor

- \(Y_{J}\) :: needs small modification for helical teeth

Geometry Factor: \(Y_{J}\)

Because of the helix angle $\psi$, the geometry factor which accounts for the tooth size and its geometry is slightly modified.

#+NAME: fig: geometry factor for helical gears
#+CAPTION: Geometry factor for helical gears
[[./pictures/Gears/geometry-factor-helical.png]]

The geometry factor also has to be modified by another multiplier which accounts for the mating gear.

#+NAME: fig: factor multiplier
#+CAPTION: Geometry factor multiplier for helical gears
[[./pictures/Gears/geometry-factor-multiplier-helical.png]]

*** Example: Meshing helical gears

  A pair of meshing helical gears is connected at the input side to a 0.5-hp motor at 1800 rpm and to an output shaft at 600 rpm. The input gear has 18 teeth, $\phi_{n}$ = 20$^{\circ}$, $m_{n}$ = 0.00173, $\psi$ = 30$^{\circ}$, $b$ = 2 cm. From the given information, determine the pitch line velocity $v_{t}$, gear tooth forces $F_{t}, F_{r}, \text{ and } F_{a}$, and bending stress $\sigma$.

  Calculate tangential module from normal module, then pitch diameter and tangential velocity.

  \begin{align*}
    m_{t} &= \frac{m_{n}}{\cos 30^{\circ}} = \frac{0.00173}{\cos 30^{\circ}} = 0.002 \\
    d &= mz = 0.002(18) = 0.036 \text{ m} \\
    v_{t} &= \omega \frac{d}{2}  = (1800) \frac{2\pi}{60} \frac{0.036}{2} = 3.4 \text{ m/s}
  \end{align*}

  Transmitted power only depends on tangential force, after which we can calculate axial and radial forces.
  \begin{align*}
    F_{t} &= \frac{H}{v_{t}} = \frac{0.5(746)}{3.4} = 104 \text{ N} \\
    \tan \phi_{t} &= \frac{\tan \phi_{n}}{\cos \psi} = \frac{\tan 20^{\circ}}{\cos 30^{\circ}} = 0.42 \\
    \phi_{t} &= 22.8^{\circ} \\
    F_{r} &= F_{t}\tan \phi_{t} = 104 \tan 22.8^{\circ} = 43.7 \text{ N} \\
    F_{a} &= F_{t} \tan \psi = 104 \tan 30^{\circ} = 60 \text{ N}
  \end{align*}

  \begin{align*}
    \sigma &= \frac{F_{t}}{bY_{J}m}K_{v}K_{o}(0.93K_{m}) \\
  \end{align*}

  $b$ = 0.02 m

  For 18-teeth to 54-teeth mesh, $Y_{J}$ = 0.99(0.42) = 0.416

  Uniform-uniform input-output, $K_{o}$ = 1

  For $K_{v}$, since $v_{t}$ = 3.57 m/s, let $Q$ = 6.
  \begin{align*}
     B &= 0.25(12 - 6)^{2/3} = 0.825 \\
     A &= 50 + 56(1 - 0.825) = 59.8 \\
     K_{v} &= \left( \frac{59.8 + \sqrt{200v_{t}}}{59.8} \right)^{0.825} = 1.36 \\
  \end{align*}

  For $K_{m}$, nothing specific about gears or mounting, let's go with the middle case for $b$ = 2 cm. $K_{m}$ = 1.6

  We can finally calculate $\sigma$

  \begin{align*}
    \sigma &= \frac{F_{t}}{bY_{J}m}K_{v}K_{o}(0.93K_{m}) \\
           &= \frac{104}{(0.02)(0.416)(0.002)}(1.36)(1)((0.93)1.6) \\
           &= 1.26 \times 10^{7} = 12.6 \text{ MPa}
  \end{align*}

** Bevel Gears

[[./pictures/Gears/bevel-gear-forces.png]]

\begin{align}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    d_{av} &= d - b \sin \gamma \\
    v_{av} &= \omega \dfrac{d_{av}}{2} \\
    F_{t} &= \dfrac{H}{v_t} \\
    F_{a} &= F_{t} \tan \phi \sin \gamma \\
    F_{r} &= F_{t} \tan \phi \cos \gamma
  \end{array}
\end{align}

Design equations for bevel gears are similar to the spur gear equations with small modification.

\begin{align}
    \sigma &= \frac{F_{t}}{bY_{J}m} K_{v} K_{o} K_{m} \\
    S_{e}^{\prime} &= S_{e}C_{L}C_{G}C_{S}k_{r}k_{t}k_{ms}
  \end{align}

Geometry Factor: \(Y_{J}\)

Because the tooth bevel gears do not have constant thickness, the geometry factors is modified.

#+NAME: fig: geometry factor bevel
#+CAPTION: Geometry factors for bevel gears
[[./pictures/Gears/geometry-factor-bevel.png]]

Mounting Factor: \(K_{m}\)

This factor accounts for increased stress from misalignment in the gears. In the case of bevel gears, this depends mainly on how the gears are supported. In a straddle mounting, a gear is fitted in between two bearings, providing the best support and highest rigidity. On the other hand, in an overhung mounting, a gear is fitted onto a free end of the shaft, which provides minimal rigidity.

#+NAME: tab: bevel mounting factor
#+CAPTION: Mounting factor $K_m$ for bevel gears

    straddle-overhung & \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{pictures/Gears/straddle-overhung} & 1.1 to 1.4 \\

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

***** Example: Bevel Gearset Design

  Identical bevel gears has a module of 0.005 m/teeth, 25 teeth, 2-cm face width, and a $20^{\circ}$ normal pressure angle. The gear quality is $Q = 7$. Both requires overhung mounting. The gears are made of ductile iron whose $S_{e}$ = 95 MPa. Determine the power rating of the gearset at 600 rpm.

***** Solution: Bevel Gearset Design

For the stress side,
\begin{align*}
  d_{av} &= mz/1000 = 0.125 \text{ m} \\
  v_{t} &= \omega \frac{d_{av}}{2} = 600 \frac{2\pi}{60} \frac{0.125}{2} = 3.93 \text{ m/s}
\end{align*}
For uniform-uniform loading, $K_{o} = 1$
\begin{align*}
  B &= 0.25(12 - 7)^{2/3} = 0.731 \\
  A &= 50 + 56(1 - 0.731) = 65 \\
  K_{v} &= \left( \frac{65 + \sqrt{200(3.93)}}{65} \right)^{0.731} = 1.3
\end{align*}

For both-overhung mounting, $K_{m} = 1.5$

For 25-teeth pair, $Y_{J}$ = 0.22

Now, onto the strength side,

\begin{description}
  \item[$C_L$] = 1 for bending
  \item[$C_{s}$] = 0.75 for machined surface
  \item[$C_{G}$] = 1
\end{description}

No requirement on the reliablility. Let's be generous, give it 90\% so that $k_{r} = 0.897$.

For normal operating temperature, $k_{t}$ = 1.

For one-way bending, $k_{ms}$ = 1.4.

Set the two sides equal ($N_{s}$ = 1), we have

\begin{gather*}
  \frac{F_{t}}{(0.02)(0.22)(0.005)}(1.3)(1)(1.5) = 95 \times 10^{6} (1)(1)(0.75)(0.897)(1)(1.4) \\
  F_{t} = 1009 \text{ N} \\
  H = F_{t}v_{t} = 1009(3.93) = 3965 \text{ W} = 5.31 \text{ hp}
\end{gather*}

** Worms and Worm Gears

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width \textwidth
[[./pictures/Gears/worm-gear-forces.png]]

- Without friction

\begin{align}
  F_{wt} &= F \cos \phi_{n} \sin \lambda \\
  F_{wr} &= F \sin \phi_{n} \\
  F_{wa} &= F \cos \phi_{n} \cos \lambda
\end{align}

- With friction \(F_{f} = \mu F\)

\begin{align}
  F_{wt} &= F \cos \phi_{n} \sin \lambda + \mu F \cos \lambda = F_{ga} \\
  F_{wr} &= F \sin \phi_{n} = F_{gr} \\
  F_{wa} &= F \cos \phi_{n} \cos \lambda - \mu F \sin \lambda = F_{gt}
\end{align}

Worm Efficiency

- Worm and worm gear velocities can be related by

\begin{align*}
  \frac{v_{g}}{v_{w}} &= \tan \lambda \\
  v_{s} &= \sqrt{v_{w}^{2} + v_{g}^{2}} = v_{g} \sqrt{1 + \tan^{2} \lambda}
\end{align*}

- Efficiency \(\eta\) is

\begin{align}
  \eta &= \frac{F_{gt}v_{g}}{F_{wt}v_{w}} \\
       &= \frac{\cos \phi_{n} \cos \lambda - \mu \sin \lambda}{\cos \phi_{n} \sin \lambda + \mu \cos \lambda} \tan \lambda \\
       &= \frac{\cos \phi_{n} - \mu \tan \lambda}{\cos \phi_{n} + \mu \cot \lambda}
\end{align}

*** Self locking

- Thread will lock itself (not backdrivable) when $F_{wt} \leqslant 0$

  \begin{align}
    F_{wt} &= F \cos \phi_{n} \sin \lambda - \mu F \cos \lambda \leqslant 0 \\
    \mu &\geqslant \cos \phi_{n} \tan \lambda
  \end{align}

- Desirable in cases where auto-braking is needed

- In systems with large inertia, sudden stop can break the worm tooth
  \(\rightarrow\) alternative brake mechanism is needd

*** Design Equation

Worm gears have higher stresses than worm, so our main concern is designing the gear.

\begin{align*}
  F_{gt, allow} = \frac{C_{s}d^{0.8}bC_{m}C_{v}}{75.948}
\end{align*}

  \item[$d$] gear diameter [mm]
  \item[$b$] effective face width (actual width but less than 0.67$d_{w}$) [mm]
  \item[$C_{m}$] ratio correction factor

**** $C_{v}$: Velocity factor

Depends on sliding velocity at mean worm diameter $v_{s}$:

\begin{align*}
  C_{v} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lll}
    0.659 e^{-0.2165 v_{s}} &  & 0 < v_{s} \leqslant 3.556 \text{ m/s}\\
    0.652 v_{s}^{-0.571} &  & 3.556 < v_{s} \leqslant 15.24 \text{ m/s}\\
    1.098 v_{s}^{-0.774} &  & v_{s} > 15.24 \text{ m/s}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{align*}

***** Example: Worm gear speed reducer

A 2-hp, 1200-rpm motor drives a 60-rpm machanism by using a work gear reducer. The gear has \(D_{gear}\) = 20 cm. The worm has \(\alpha\) = 12\(^{\circ}\), \(\theta\) = 20\(^{\circ}\), and \(D_{worm}\) = 5 cm. Assume \(\mu\) = 0.03, determine

1. all force components according to the rated power

2. power delivered to the driven mechanism

3. whether the drive is self-locking

4. safety factor of worm gear

***** Solution: Worm gear speed reducer

First, determine $v_{w}$ to determine $v_{g}$

\begin{align*}
  v_{w} &= \omega_{w} (d_{w}/2) = 3.14 \text{ m/s} \\
  v_{g} &= v_{w} \tan \lambda = 3.14 \tan 12^{\circ} \\
        &= 0.667 \text{ m/s}
\end{align*}

Power output at the worm gear is

\begin{align*}
  \eta &= \frac{\cos \phi_{n} - \mu \tan \lambda}{\cos \phi_{n} + \mu \cot \lambda} = \frac{\cos 20^{\circ} - 0.1 \tan 12^{\circ}}{\cos 20^{\circ} + 0.1 \cot 12^{\circ}} = 0.65 \\
  H_{g} &= 0.65(2)(746) = 970 \text{ W} \\
  F_{gt} &= \frac{H_{g}}{v_{g}} = \frac{970}{0.667} \\
       &= 1454 \text{ N}
\end{align*}

The other forces can then be calculated.

\begin{align*}
  F_{ga} &= F_{wt} = \frac{H_{w}}{v_{w}} = \frac{2(746)}{3.14} = 475 \text{ N}
\end{align*}

To find $F_{wr} = F_{gr}$, we need first to find $F$, which we can solve from either $F_{gt}$ or $F_{ga}$

\begin{align*}
  F_{ga} = 475 &= F \cos \phi_{n} \sin \lambda + \mu F \cos \lambda = F \left( \cos 20^{\circ} \sin 12^{\circ} + 0.1 \cos 12^{\circ} \right) \\
  475 &= 0.293F \\
  F &= 1620 \text{ N} \\
  F_{gr} &= F \sin \phi_{n} = 1620 \sin 20^{\circ} = 554 \text{ N}
\end{align*}

Self locking

\begin{align*}
  \mu \geqslant \cos 20^{\circ} \tan 12^{\circ} \\
  0.1 \geqslant 0.20
\end{align*}

Nope!

Definition of safety factor

\begin{align*}
  N_{s} &= \frac{F_{gt,allow}}{F_{gt}}
\end{align*}

Determine the allowable tangential force on worm gear and material factor

\begin{align*}
  F_{gt,allow} &= \frac{C_{s}d^{0.8}bC_{m}C_{v}}{75.948} \\
  C &= \frac{d_{g}}{2} + \frac{d_{w}}{2} = \frac{0.2 + 0.05}{2} = 0.125 \text{ m} \\
  C_{s} &= 1000 \hspace{1cm}\text{(assume centrifugally-cast)}
\end{align*}

Ratio correction factor
\begin{align*}
  e &= 1200/60 = 20 \\
  C_{m}&= 0.02 \sqrt{-20^{2} + 40(20) - 76} + 0.46 = 0.82
\end{align*}

Velocity factor
\begin{align*}
  v_{s} &= v_{g}\sqrt{1+\tan^{2} \lambda} = 0.667 \sqrt{1 + \tan^{2} 12^{\circ}} = 0.682 \text{ m/s} \\
  C_{v} &= 0.659e^{-0.2165(0.682)} = 0.569
\end{align*}

Finally, the safety factor

\begin{align*}
  F_{gt,allow} &= 1000(200)^{0.8}(0.67(50))(0.82)(0.569)/75.948 = 14265 \text{ N} \\
  N_{s} &= \frac{14265}{1454} = 9.81
\end{align*}

** Clutches and Brakes

*** Clutches vs Brakes

Clutches are mechanical power transmission devices made to easily engage and disengage a drive shaft from a driven shaft. Brakes, on the other hand, are mechanical device that prevents motion by absorbing kinetic energy from moving systems, typically converting them to heat by way of friction. At first it seems strange that the two would be mentioned in the same chapter, but further investigation should lead to a realization that they are both friction mechanical devices that are easy to engage and disengage from a rotating source. In another word, when engaged

- Clutches :: \(\omega_{in} = \omega_{out} \neq 0\)

- Brakes :: \(\omega_{in} = \omega_{out} = 0\)

**** Considerations for Clutch and Brake

- Actuating force :: force to engage clutch/brake
- Transmitted torque :: torque through mechanism
- Energy loss :: energy dissipated before mechanism is fully engaged
- Temperature rise :: temperature increase from energy loss

**** External Drum Brake

#+CAPTION: Forces and dimensions of an external drum brake.

***** Torque Generated on the Drum

- identical equations to internal drum brake, only need to be careful
  about the direction of actuating force

***** Example: Braking torque of a drum brake

[[./pictures/Clutches-Brakes/drum-example.png]]


- \(F\) = 2000 N

- \(\mu\) = 0.3

- \(b\) = 3 cm

Determine the braking torque.

***** Solution

First, we must determine \(p_{\max}\) on the right shoe. In this case,
\(M_n\) and \(M_f\) go in opposite directions.

\begin{align*}
  Fc &= M_n - M_f \\
  M_n &= \frac{p_{\max} bra}{4(\sin \theta)_{\max}} [2(\theta_2 - \theta_1) - \sin 2\theta_2 + \sin 2\theta_1]
\end{align*}

Let us first find \(M_n\) as a function of \(p_{\max}\)

\begin{align*}
  a &= \sqrt{ 0.112^2 + 0.05^2 } = 0.123 \text{ m} \\
  M_n &= \frac{p_{\max} bra}{4(\sin \theta)_{\max}} [2(\theta_2 - \theta_1) - \sin 2\theta_2 + \sin 2\theta_1] \\
    &= \frac{p_{\max} (0.03)(0.15)(0.123)}{4 (\sin 90^{\circ})} \left[ 2(126^{\circ}(\frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}})) - \sin (2(126^{\circ})) \right] \\
    &= 7.38 \times 10^{-4} p_{\max}
\end{align*}

Now find \(M_f\) as a function of \(p_{\max}\)

\begin{align*}
  M_f &= \frac{\mu p_{\max} br}{(\sin \theta)_{\max}} \left[ r( \cos \theta_1 - \cos \theta_2) + \frac{a}{4}(\cos 2\theta_2 - \cos 2\theta_1) \right] \\
      &= \frac{0.3 p_{\max} (0.03)(0.15)}{\sin 90^{\circ}} \left[ (0.15)(\cos 0 - \cos 126^{\circ}) + \frac{0.123}{4}(\cos 2(126^{\circ}) - \cos 2(0)) \right] \\
      &= 2.67 \times 10^{-4} p_{\max}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
  Fc &= M_n - M_f \\
  2000(0.212) &= p_{\max}(7.38 - 2.67) \times 10^{-4} \\
  p_{\max} &= 9.00 \times 10^5 \text{ Pa}
\end{align*}

Braking torque of the right shoe is

\begin{align*}
  T_R &= \frac{\mu r^2 bp_{\max}}{(\sin \theta)_{\max}} (\cos \theta_1 - \cos \theta_2) \\
      &= \frac{(0.3)(0.15^2)(0.03)(9.00 \times 10^5)}{1} (\cos 0^{\circ} - \cos 126^{\circ}) \\
      &= 289 \text{ N-m}
\end{align*}

To calculate braking torque in left shoe, we also must calculate
\(p_{\max}\). \(M_n\) and \(M_f\) are now both clockwise.

\begin{align*}
  Fc &= M_n + M_f \\
  2000(0.212) &= (7.38 + 2.67) \times 10^{-4} p_{\max} \\
  p_{\max} &= 4.22 \times 10^5 \text{ Pa}
\end{align*}

Braking torque of the left shoe is

\begin{align*}
  T_L &= \frac{\mu r^2 bp_{\max}}{(\sin \theta)_{\max}} (\cos \theta_1 - \cos \theta_2) \\
      &= \frac{(0.3)(0.15^2)(0.03)(4.22 \times 10^5)}{1} (\cos 0^{\circ} - \cos 126^{\circ}) \\
      &= 136 \text{ N-m}
\end{align*}

Total braking torque is

\begin{align*}
  T &= T_L + T_R \\
    &= 289 + 136 = 425 \text{ N-m}
\end{align*}

*** Band Brakes
**** Principles of Band Brakes

- Rely on friction between band and drum

- Similar to pulley-belt system

\begin{align}
  T = (F_1 - F_2)r
\end{align}

**** Belt Tension

[[./pictures/Clutches-Brakes/band-brake.png]]

\begin{align}
  dF &= \mu dN \nonumber \\
  dN &= 2(F d\theta/2) = Fd\theta \nonumber \\
  \frac{dF}{F} &= \mu d\theta \nonumber \\
  \ln \frac{F_1}{F_2} &= \mu \theta \nonumber \\
  \frac{F_1}{F_2} &= e^{\mu\theta}
\end{align}

***** Example: An Exercise Bike
An exercise bike has an adjustable band brake on the wheel to provide different levels of resistance. What should the slack side belt tension be so that the biker can exercise with \(T\) = 50 N-m. Take \(\theta = 150^{\circ}\) and \(\mu = 0.2\), the bike wheel \(r = 50\) cm.

***** Solution

\begin{align*}
  \frac{F_1}{F_2} &= e^{\mu\theta} \\
  T &= (F_1 - F_2)r \\
  T &= (e^{\mu \theta} - 1) F_2 r \\
  F_2 &= \frac{50}{(e^{0.3(150(\pi/180))}) - 1)(0.5)} \\
                  &= 83.8 \text{ N}
\end{align*}

*** Disc Clutches and Brakes
**** Working Principles

[[./pictures/Clutches-Brakes/disc-brake-components.png]]

**** Disc Wear

- new disc is rigid

- uniform pressure at first, but the outer area wears faster because of
  higher velocity

- after a while, pressure is no longer uniform, but wear becomes uniform

**** Torque Calculation

1. Uniform pressure: new disc

2. Uniform wear: old disc

\begin{align}
    dF &= p dA \nonumber \\
    dT &= \mu rdF = \mu r p dA \nonumber \\
    T &= \int_{r_o}^{r_i} \int_0^{2\pi} \mu r p (rdrd\theta) \\
        &= \frac{2}{3} \mu \pi p \left( r_o^3 - r_i^3 \right)
\end{align}

- Taking the actuating force \(F = p \pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2)\)

  \[T = \frac{2\mu F \left( r_o^3 - r_i^3 \right)}{3 \left( r_o^2 - r_i^2 \right)}\]

- For \(N\) parallel discs

  \[T = \frac{2\mu F N \left( r_o^3 - r_i^3 \right)}{3 \left( r_o^2 - r_i^2 \right)}\]

**** Uniform Rate of Wear

- Rate of Wear \(\propto\) Friction Work Rate

  \[pr = C\]

- Max pressure occurs at inside radius, hence the constant is

  \[pr = C = p_{\max}r_i\]

**** Braking Torque

\begin{align}
    dF &= pdA \\
    dT &= \mu r dF = \mu r p dA = \mu p_{\max} r_i dA \\
    T &= p_{\max} r_i \int_{r_o}^{r_i} \int_0^{2\pi} r dr d\theta \\
        &= \mu \pi p_{\max} r_i \left( r_o^2 - r_i^2 \right)\end{align}

- Taking into account actuating force \(F\)

\[T = \mu F \left( \frac{r_o + r_i}{2} \right)\]

- For \(N\) parallel discs

\[T = \mu F N \left( \frac{r_o + r_i}{2} \right)\]

*** Usual Guideline for Disc Brakes/Clutches

1. \(0.45r_o < r_i < 0.8r_o\)

2. Use uniform wear rate, unless for short-term application

***** Example: Automotive Clutch

- Design a wet clutch to transfer the torque of 100 N-m using the
  material with \(\mu\) = 0.08 and \(p_{\max}\) = 1500 kPa. Space
  requirements only allow \(r_o \leqslant\) 60 mm. Determine the inner
  diameter and number of discs.

***** Solution

- Use \(r_i\) = 30 mm,

\begin{align*}
  N &= \frac{T}{\mu \pi p_{\max} r_i \left( r_o^2 - r_i^2 \right)} \\
    &= \frac{100}{(0.08)\pi(1500 \times 10^3)(0.03) \left( 0.06^2 - 0.03^2 \right)}
\end{align*}

\(N\) = 4 and \(d_i = 2r_i\) = 60 mm

                    &= \frac{(F_{1} - F_{c})/(F_{2} - F_{c}) + 1}{(F_{1} - F_{c})/(F_{2} - F_{c}) - 1} \\
                    &= \frac{e^{\mu\theta} + 1}{e^{\mu\theta} - 1} \\
  F_{i} &= \frac{T}{d}\frac{e^{\mu \theta} + 1}{e^{\mu \theta} - 1}

- Note: $F_{i} = 0 \rightarrow T = 0$

**** Tight and Slack Side Tensions

**** Velocity Correction Factor: $C_v$

- $C_v$ = 1 for polyamide and urethane belts

***** Example: Flat belt design

A polyamide A-3 flat belt 15 cm wide is used to transmit 15 hp power. The pulley rotational axes are parallel, the shafts are 2.5 m apart. The driving pulley diameter is 15 cm and rotates at 1750 rpm. The driven pulley diameter is 45 cm.

1. Estimate the centrifugal tension $F_c$
2. Determine the required initial tension $F_{i}$
3. Estimate the allowable $F_1$ and $F_2$
# 4. Determine $N_s$

***** Solution: Flat belt design

Find $F_c$

   \begin{align*}
   \gamma &= 11.4 \text{ kN/m}^3 \\
   \rho &= \frac{\gamma}{g} = 11.4 \times 10^3 / 9.81 = 1.162 \times 10^3 \text{ kg/m}^3 \\
   m &= \rho A = 1.162 \times 10^3 (3.3 \times 10^{-3})(0.15) = 0.575 \text{ kg/m} \\
   F_c &= m \omega^2 r^2 = 0.575 \times (1750 (2\pi/60))^2 (0.15/2)^2 = 108.6 \text{ N}
   \end{align*}

First, find $\theta$ on the smaller pulley (smaller pulley = smaller angle)
\begin{align*}
    \theta_{d} &= \pi - 2\sin^{-1}\frac{D-d}{2C} \\
               &= \pi - 2\sin^{-1}\frac{45 - 15}{2(250)} \\
               &= 3.02 \text{ rad}
\end{align*}

Next, find input torque $T$
\begin{align*}
    T &= \frac{H}{\omega} = \frac{15(746)}{1750\frac{2\pi}{60}} \\
      &= 61.1 \text{ N-m}
\end{align*}

Finally,
\begin{align*}
    F_{i} &= \frac{T}{d}\frac{e^{\mu\theta} + 1}{e^{\mu\theta} - 1} \\
          &= \frac{61.1}{0.15}\frac{e^{0.8(3.02)} + 1}{e^{0.8(3.02)} - 1} \\
          &= 487 \text{ N}
\end{align*}

For $F_1$ and $F_2$

*** V-Belts



**** Why V Belts?

- Increased tension forces belt further into groove, providing more
  friction

- Increased torque capacity at a slightly lower efficiency

**** Belt Tension

\begin{align}
  T = \left( F_1 - F_2 \right) r \\
  \frac{F_1 - F_c}{F_2 - F_c} = e^{\frac{\mu \theta}{\sin \beta}}
\end{align}

**** V Belt Design Equation

\begin{align}
  N_s = \frac{P_a N}{P_{nom} K_s}
\end{align}

- \(N_s\) :: safety factor

- \(P_a\) :: allowable power per belt

- \(N\) :: number of belts (integer)

- \(P_{nom}\) :: nominal power = \((F_1 - F_2)v\)

- \(K_s\) :: service factor

**** Allowable Power

**** Service Factor

[[./pictures/Flexible-Elements/belt-service-factor.png]]

*** Timing Belts

[[./pictures/Flexible-Elements/timing-belt.jpg]]

- No significant stretch or slip \(\rightarrow\) power where speed ratio
  is important

- efficiency of 97 - 99%

- No need for lubrication

- Quieter than chain drives

- Same design equations as V-belts

***** Example: Design of Belts

Design an F-1 polyamide flat belt to connect two shafts. The driving pulley ($d$ = 4 cm) is connected to a 1-kW motor. The driven pulley has $D$ = 8 cm. The shafts are 20 cm apart. The motor rotates at 500 rpm.

***** Solution

The required belt tension difference is

\begin{align*}
    P &= \left( F_1 - F_2 \right)v \\
    F_1 - F_2 &= \frac{1000}{500\pi(0.04)(1/60)} = 955 \text{ N}
\end{align*}

Actual allowable tension is

\begin{align*}
    (F_1)_a = b(6000)(0.7)(1) = 4200b \text{ N}
\end{align*}

Centrifugal tension $F_c$ is

\begin{align*}
    F_c &= m \omega^2 r^2 \\
        &= \frac{9500b(0.0013)}{10} \left( \frac{500(2\pi)}{60} \right)^2 (0.02)^2 \\
        &= 1.35b \text{ N}
\end{align*}

Angle on small pulley $\theta_d$ is

\begin{align*}
    \theta_d &= \pi - 2 \sin^{-1} \frac{D - d}{2C} \\
            &= \pi - 2 \sin^{-1} \frac{8 - 4}{2(20)} \\
            &= 2.94 \text{ rad}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    \frac{(F_1)_a - F_c}{F_2 - F_c} &= e^{\mu \theta} \\
    \frac{4200b - 1.35b}{4200b - 955 - 1.35b} &= e^{0.5(2.94)} \\
    b &= 0.295 \text{ m}
\end{align*}

The belt must be at least 29.5 cm in width.

*** Roller Chains

**** Roller Chain components

#+NAME: roller chain components
#+CAPTION: Components of a typical roller chain
[[./pictures/Flexible-Elements/roller-chain-parts.jpg]]

**** Why Roller Chain (Chain Drives)?

- No slip \(\rightarrow\) constant ratio

- Long life

- Can drive multiple shafts from a single source

**** Equations on Roller Chains

\begin{align}
  D = \frac{p}{\sin \left( \dfrac{180^{\circ}}{N} \right)} \\
  V = N pn
\end{align}

- \(N\) = number of sprocket teeth

- \(p\) = chain pitch

- \(n\) = sprocket speed in revolution/min

**** Design Criteria

- Roller chains rarely fail because of tensile stress

- Need to worry more about fatigue and wear on rollers

- To minimize chordal speed variation. \(N \geqslant 17\)

**** Standard Chain Dimensions

#+NAME: chain catalog
#+CAPTION: Dimensions of standard ANSI roller chain
[[./pictures/Flexible-Elements/chain-ansi-dims.png]]

**** Power Capacity

- For link-plate limit

\[H_1 = 0.004 N_1^{1.08} n_1^{0.9} p^{3-0.07p} \text{ hp}\]

- For roller limit

\[H_2 = \frac{1000 K_t N_1^{1.5} p^{0.8}}{n_1^{1.5}} \text{ hp}\]

- \(N_1\) = number of teeth in smaller sprocket

- \(n_1\) = sprocker speed [rev/min]

- \(p\) = pitch of chain [in]

- \(K_r\) = 29 for chain numbers 25,35; 3.4 for 41; and 17 for 40-240

**** Roller Chain Rated Capacity

#+NAME: chain rated capacity
#+CAPTION: Rate power capacity for standard roller chains
[[./pictures/Flexible-Elements/chain-rated-capacity.png]]


***** Example

Pick a roller chain for a motorcycle whose output is 15 hp. The driving sprocket has 20 teeth and the output has 39 teeth.

***** Solution

\begin{align*}
    H_1 &= 0.004(20)^{1.08}(1000)^{0.9}(0.75)^{3-0.07(0.75)} \\
        &= 21.8 \text{ hp} \\
    H_2 &= \frac{1000(17)(20)^{1.5}(0.75)^{0.8}}{1000^{1.5}} \\
        &= 38.2 \text{ hp}
\end{align*}

This means the chain can deliver the power with the safety factor of 21.8/15 = 1.45

** Power Transmission System Design

In previous chapters, we have discussed the design of individual power transmission components. At last, in this final chapter, we are putting them all together, exploring the design of power transmission systems.

*** Power Transmission System Design Considerations

***** Example: Design of a Conveyor Belt System

Let us consider a design for a conveyor belt system. The conveyor belt needs to be moving at 60 cm/s. Both the driving and driven pulleys have the same diameter of 40 cm. The driving pulley is mounted on the same shaft as spur gear \(B\), which is driven by spur gear \(A\) connected directly to the driving motor.

Spur gear \(A\) has \(D_{\text{pitch},A}\) = 5 cm, \(z\) = 10 teeth, and pressure angle \(\theta\) = 20\(^{\circ}\). The motor is set to operate constantly at 500 rpm and providing the torque of 2 N-m.

Design the following:

1. the driven spur gear \(B\) (determine the number of teeth and pitch
   diameter).

2. width \(b\) of the conveyor belt. (Belt material is polyamide F-1,
   \(\mu\) = 0.5, thickness \(t\) = 1.3 mm, \(\gamma\) = 9.5
   kN/m\(^{3}\), \(F_{a}\) = 6 kN/m, \(C_{v}\) = 1)

3. the radius of the shaft on which spur gear \(B\) and the driving
   pulley are mounted. (\(E\) = 210 GPa, \(S_{y}\) = 300 MPa, \(N_{s}\)
   = 2.5)

4. radial contact bearings for 9 \(\times 10^{7}\) revolutions, 90%
   reliability (series and bore size).

***** Solution: Design of a Conveyor Belt System

1. To determine the number of teeth of spur gear \(B\), we need to determine the required pitch line velocity. The belt must be moving at 60 cm/s, which means the pulley must be rotating at

   #+NAME: angular_velocity

d_pitch = 0.05
z_A = 10
m = d_pitch/z_A
z_B = 2*r_b/m
T_A = 2
T_B = T_A*z_B/z_A
tension_diff = T_B / d_pitch
return round(rev_per_sec_a,2), round(rpm_a,1), round(r_b,3), m, round(z_B,1), round(tension_diff)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS: angular_velocity
   | 0.95 | 57.3 | 0.218 | 0.005 | 87.3 | 349 |

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :result output :var ang1=angular_velocity[0] ang2=angular_velocity[1]
   \begin{align*}
     \omega_{\text{pulley}} &= \frac{0.6}{\pi (0.2)} \\
                            &= ang1 \text{ rev/s} = ang2 \text{ rpm}
   \end{align*}
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_export latex

        \omega_{\text{pulley}} &= \frac{0.6}{\pi (0.2)} \\

      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

   since spur gear \(B\) is mounted on the same shaft as the pulley, it must have the same \(\omega\). The pitch line velocities on two meshing gears must be the same. Spur gear \(A\) rotates at 500 rpm, therefore, the pitch radius of spur gear \(B\) is

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :var r_b=angular_velocity[2]
   \begin{align*}
     r_{B} &= \frac{\omega_{A} r_{A}}{\omega_{B}} \\

      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

   Its diameter, of course, is src_python[:results raw :var r_b =angular_velocity[2] :cache yes]{return(r_b*2*100)} cm. Given that
   meshing gears must also have the same module, the number of teeth on \(B\) is

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :var module=angular_velocity[3] z_B=angular_velocity[4]
   \begin{align*}
     m &= \frac{D_{\text{pitch},A}}{z_{A}} = \frac{0.05}{10} = module \\
       &= \frac{43.6}{z_{B}} \\
     z_{B} &= z_B \text{ teeth}
   \end{align*}
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{align*}
        m &= \frac{D_{\text{pitch},A}}{z_{A}} = \frac{0.05}{10} = 0.005 \\
          &= \frac{43.6}{z_{B}} \\
        z_{B} &= 87.3 \text{ teeth}
      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

2. Assuming no power loss, the power the belt-pulley system needs to transfer is $H = T\omega = 2(500)(2\pi/60)$ = src_python[:results raw :cache yes]{return(round(2*500*2*3.1416/60,1))} W.

   Required torque transfer of the belt is $T = P/\omega = 104.7/(57.3(2\pi/60))$ = src_python[:results raw :cache yes]{return(round(104.7/57.3/2/3.1416*60,1))} N-m. The tension difference on the two side needs to be

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :var tension_diff=angular_velocity[5]
   \begin{align*}
     T &= (F_{1} - F_{2})r_{\text{pulley}} \\
     F_{1} - F_{2} &= \frac{T}{r_{\text{pulley}}} = tension_diff \text{ N}
   \end{align*}
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{align*}
        T &= (F_{1} - F_{2})r_{\text{pulley}} \\
        F_{1} - F_{2} &= \frac{T}{r_{\text{pulley}}} = 349 \text{ N}
      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

   We can now write an equation to determine the thickness \(b\) of the belt

   \begin{align*}
     \frac{F_{1} - F_{c}}{F_{2} - F_{c}} = e^{\mu \theta}
   \end{align*}

     \frac{4200b - 1.76b}{4200b - 87 - 1.76b} &= e^{0.5 \pi} \\
     b &= 0.0261 = 2.61 \text{ cm}
   \end{align*}
   #+end_export

3. To design the shaft, we must first determine the loads on the shaft, which are exerted by spur gear \(B\) and the pulley. Let us determine the load from each component.

   The load from the gear can simply be determined by

   #+NAME: force
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports none :cache yes
from math import cos,radians
force = 17.4/0.2/cos(radians(20))
return round(force,1)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS: force
   : 92.6

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :var force=force
   \begin{align*}
     F &= \frac{T}{r \cos \theta} \\
       &= \frac{17.4}{(0.2)(\cos 20^{\circ})} \\
       &= force \text{ N}
   \end{align*}
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{align*}
        F &= \frac{T}{r \cos \theta} \\
          &= \frac{17.4}{(0.2)(\cos 20^{\circ})} \\
          &= 92.6 \text{ N}
      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

   So the force exerted on the shaft by gear \(B\) is 92.6 N in the direction of 20\(^{\circ}\) downward from the tangential line between the two gears.

   The load from the pulley is even simpler

   #+NAME: sum_force
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports none :cache yes
sum_force = 4200*0.0261 + 4200*0.0261 - 87
return sum_force
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS: sum_force
   : 132.24

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :var sum_force=sum_force
   \begin{align*}
     F_{p} &= F_{1} + F_{2} = 4200(0.0261) + 4200(0.0261) - 87 \\
           &= sum_force \text{ N}
   \end{align*}
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{align*}
        F_{p} &= F_{1} + F_{2} = 4200(0.0261) + 4200(0.0261) - 87 \\
              &= 132.24 \text{ N}
      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

   The force exerted on the shaft by the pulley is 132 N to the right.

   Now all we need is to determine the maximum bending moment on the
   shaft.

   First, bending moment \(M_{g}\) generated by force in the gear is

   #+NAME: M_g
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports none :cache yes
M_g = 92.6*0.1*(0.4-0.1)/0.4
return round(M_g,2)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS: M_g
   : 6.95

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :var M_g=M_g
   \begin{align*}
     M_{g} &= \frac{F_{g}x(L-x)}{L} = \frac{92.6(0.1)(0.4-0.1)}{0.4} \\
           &= M_g \text{ N-m}
   \end{align*}
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{align*}
        M_{g} &= \frac{F_{g}x(L-x)}{L} = \frac{92.6(0.1)(0.4-0.1)}{0.4} \\
              &= 6.95 \text{ N-m}
      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

   Next, bending moment \(M_{p}\) generaed by force on the pulley is

   #+NAME: M_p
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports none :cache yes
M_p = 132*0.1*(0.4-0.1)/0.4
return round(M_p,2)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS: M_p
   : 9.9

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :var M_p=M_p
   \begin{align*}
     M_{p} &= \frac{F_{p}x(L-x)}{L} = \frac{132(0.3)(0.4-0.3)}{0.4} \\
           &= M_p \text{ N-m}
   \end{align*}
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{align*}
        M_{p} &= \frac{F_{p}x(L-x)}{L} = \frac{132(0.3)(0.4-0.3)}{0.4} \\
              &= 9.9 \text{ N-m}
      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

   The maximum bending moment occurs in the middle, where

   #+NAME: M_max
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports none :cache yes
M_max = (6.95 + 9.9)*2/3
return round(M_max,1)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS: M_max
   : 11.2

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :var M_max=M_max
   \begin{align*}
     M_{\max} &= (6.95 + 9.9)\frac{2}{3} \\
              &= M_max \text{ N-m}
   \end{align*}
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{align*}
        M_{\max} &= (6.95 + 9.9)\frac{2}{3} \\
                 &= 11.2 \text{ N-m}
      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

   The maximum torque is just the required torque transfer, which is
   \(T\) = 17.4 N-m. We can now determine the required shaft size.

   \begin{align}
     N_{s} &= \frac{S_{y}}{\sigma_{e}} \\
     2 &= \frac{300 \times 10^{6}}{\sqrt{ \left( \dfrac{4(11.2)}{\pi r^{3}} \right)^{2} + 3 \left( \dfrac{2(17.4)}{\pi r^{3}} \right)^{2} }} \\
     r &= 0.0054 = 5.4 \text{ mm}
   \end{align}

4. Since the problem is not symmetrical, we need to determine the bearing under the higher load. This happens to the bearing closer to the higher force, which is the pulley. Taking the other bearing as a fulcrum, the radial load in the bearing on the pulley side is

   #+NAME: F_r
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports none :cache yes
F_r = (132*3 + 92.6)/4
return round(F_r,1)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex :var F_r=F_r
   \begin{align*}
     F_{r} &= \frac{132(3)}{4} + \frac{92.6(1)}{4} \\
           &= F_r \text{ N}
   \end{align*}
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{align*}
        F_{r} &= \frac{132(3)}{4} + \frac{92.6(1)}{4} \\
              &= 122.2 \text{ N}
      \end{align*}
   #+end_export

   With \(L = 9 \times 10^{7}\) and \(K_{r} = 1\), $F_{e} = F_{r} =$ src_python[:results raw :var F_r=F_r :cache yes]{return(F_r)} = $C$. This is smaller than the smallest bore which is 10mm for all series. We therefore should pick the smallest
   bore (10 mm) as our choice.
